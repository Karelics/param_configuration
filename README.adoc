= Parameter configuration
:toc: preamble

Has parameter configuration always been pain when setting ROS Node parameters across multiple robots? Have you struggled with overriding and substituting them in launch files or tried or implement custom files and classes to read device-specific parameters?

Look no further! Parameter configuration is here to solve these issues.




== Introduction


Integration of robot fleets with ROS 2 requires specifying a hefty set of parameters for ROS Nodes. In ROS, the parameters are most often set using YAML-files which define the Node specific parameters. To avoid duplication, it is normal to reuse these files across different devices and models. This usually leads into a situation that is not scalable:

* To set some of the parameters based on the device or robot model, we need to read the YAML-parameter file in Python launch file and override the parameter with the device/model specific values using ReWrittenYaml from Nav2 or some other substitution/overriding solution. Each of this kind of parameter needs to be set individually in the launch file.
* Features such as Env variable resolution, parameter value calculation in runtime, or ROS package share path resolution requires rewriting the parameters in the ROS launch files.

Parameter configuration solves these issues by introducing Dynamic YAML variables and YAML file overlaying.


== Features

=== 1. Dynamic YAML variables
By default, YAML files do not support dynamic variables or placeholders. Parameter Configuration solves this with different types of "tags" that allow evaluating variables in runtime.

*Available tags:*

* *Eval*: Evaluates a variety of commands in runtime. Supports also file-level variables, similar to YAML anchors and aliases.
* *From*: Allows getting values from other YAML files
* *Include*: Fully includes another configuration file
* *Merge*: Merges multiple key-value pairs to be under a single key

*Supported Eval -commands*
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Command | Python function |Description

|!eval env.<env_var_name>
| os.environ.
|Environmental variable

|!eval m.<math_function>
|math.
|Any math expression

|!eval np.<numpy_function>
|numpy.
|Any numpy expression. Supports float64 and int64 types.

|!eval round()
|round()
|Rounds to given decimals

|!eval path_to()
|get_package_share_directory()
|Path to ROS package share directory

|!eval join()
|os.path.join()
|Join two or more paths

|!eval get_resolved_yaml()
|param_configuration.configuration.get_resolved_yaml
|Resolves the given YAML file and returns a path to it.

|!eval var.<var_name>
|-
|Allows using variables which are defined in the beginning of the same file, under ".variables" -key. This key will be removed from the result file.

==== Example usage

Check `examples/dynamic_yaml.yaml` for example usages. Print the final evaluated YAML result file on command line with the <<config>> command line tool, which is provided by this package:
```
cd <param_configuration-path>/examples
config print dynamic_yaml.yaml
```

=== 2. YAML file overlaying
YAML overlaying allows to set parameter overrides per device and robot model. This will greatly reduce the parameter duplication, since only the overridden parameters need to be defined.

The overlaying will automatically look for parameter files across three different levels:

* Device level
* Model level
* ROS Package level

For example, any parameter that is set in Device level configuration, will override Model level and ROS Package level configurations. The Device and Model layers are automatically fetched from a preconfigured folder. Check the <<setup>> chapter for more information.

==== Examples
Check the `examples/overlay_examples` folder for example usages. Print the final evaluated YAML result file on command line with:

[source]
----
config print config://nav2_bringup/nav2_params.yaml --config-directory <param_configuration-path>/examples/overlay_examples/
----

== Setup [[setup]]

To use YAML overlaying feature, follow these steps.

* Set `PARAM_CONFIG_DIR` env variable to point to the folder from which the overlaying fetches the parameters. For example:

[source]
----
export PARAM_CONFIG_DIR=/home/user/config_dir
----

* Create the device and model folders under the config directory and populate them with your ROS package folders and their respective parameter files. Structure of the directory needs to be the following:

[plantuml, format=svg, opts="inline"]
----
skinparam Legend {
	BackgroundColor transparent
	BorderColor transparent
	FontName "Noto Serif", "DejaVu Serif", serif
	FontSize 17
}
legend
config_dir
|_ model
  | <ros-pkg-name>
    |_ <param_file_1>.yaml
    |_ <param_file_2>.yaml
    |_ ...
|_ device
  | <ros-pkg-name>
    |_ <param_file_1>.yaml
    |_ ...
end legend
----

== Usage

To use these YAML files in ROS launch files, get the configuration file in the following way with absolute path or with overlay syntax:
```
from param_configuration.configuration import get_resolved_yaml

# Absolute path
resolved_yaml = get_resolved_yaml("/home/user/config.yaml")

# Overlay syntax
resolved_yaml_2 = get_resolved_yaml("config://nav2_bringup/nav2_params.yaml")
```

The overlay syntax is built as follows:

* `config://` tells parameter configuration to use the overlay files to resolve the configuration
* The package name `nav2_bringup` tells the configuration to also use the ROS Package layer. If not set, uses only the Model and Device parameters.
* `nav2_params.yaml` is the name of the parameter file and is expected to be found in `nav2_bringup` ROS package. If a parameter files with a same name exist in `device` and/or `model` folders, we will use them to override the ROS-level parameters.

NOTE:: The parameter files are expected to be in `params` folder within the ROS package, unlike within the `device` or `model` folders!


== Config validation [[config]]
Configurations can be easily validated with the command line tool `config`, which is provided by this package. Validate a single configuration file by printing the evaluated version of it.
[source]
----
config print /home/user/param_config.yaml
----

Print the configuration overlay structure
[source]
----
config list --config-directory /home/user/config_dir/
----
Without the --config-directory, uses the default `PARAM_CONFIG_DIR` directory.

More information with the command `config --help`


== Current limitations

* ROS layer parameters have to be in "params" -folder
* Eval variables support only two levels of nesting:
** var_1: 1 - OK
** var_2: !eval var.var_1 + 1 - OK
** var_3: !eval var.var_2 + 1 - NOT SUPPORTED
